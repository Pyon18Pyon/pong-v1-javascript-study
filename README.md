## How to play?

This is a classic Pong Game. The top paddle is a computer and the bottom paddle is a user. All you need to is to move the paddle left to right to catch the ball. If you miss it you lose. Whoever wins a game, the score counter on the left gets updated and the ball resets in the centre. Whichever scores 7 points first will win the game and you have a choice to play again. 

## Key features

- Smooth canvas animation.
- When a game starts the cursor disappears and take over the bottom paddle.
- Used requestAnimationFrame() to animate the canvas one frame at a time.
